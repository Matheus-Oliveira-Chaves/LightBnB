/*
Show all reservations for a user.

Select the reservation id, property title, reservation start_date, property cost_per_night and the average rating of the property. You'll need data from both the reservations and properties tables.
The reservations will be for a single user, so just use 1 for the user_id.
Order the results from the earliest start_date to the most recent start_date.
Limit the results to 10.
